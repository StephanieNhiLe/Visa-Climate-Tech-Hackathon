## Inspiration
Consumers increasingly seek sustainable options in their spending experiences, but often lack the information and incentives to make eco-friendly choices. This disconnect contributes to environmental degradation and limits the growth of recommerce—a market with the potential to significantly reduce carbon footprints and waste. Current recommerce participation is low, with less than 20% of consumers aware of the options available. Closing this gap can create economic opportunities and foster sustainable consumption patterns​.
## What it does
EcoFiDash addresses this critical issue by offering a comprehensive solution for tracking and optimizing sustainable transactions.

Our innovative platform transforms how consumers interact with their spending data through a personalized dashboard that seamlessly integrates with their transaction history. Key features include:
- **Carbon Footprint Tracking:** EcoFiDash calculates and visualizes the carbon footprint of each transaction, helping users understand their environmental impact in real-time.
- **Sustainable Business Recommendations:** Based on spending habits, our AI-driven system suggests eco-friendly alternatives, encouraging sustainable purchasing decisions.
- **AI Chatbot Assistance:** An integrated chatbot provides personalized insights into spending patterns and environmental impact, enhancing user awareness and engagement.
- **Recommerce Incentives:** EcoFiDash promotes recommerce by highlighting resale and redistribution options, offering rewards for sustainable spending behaviors.
